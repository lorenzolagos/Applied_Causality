Seventh Journal Entry: 04/03/2017

A few weeks ago, I presented progres on my project to the class. We are now in the final stages for submittng the last deliverable. So i would like to write down my goals for the May 12 deadline.

1) Collective Bragaining Agreements:
-Need to use a subsample of my data to check whether what I am doing makes sense
-Start with the 2008 worker-spell observations in Roraima (one of the smallest states in Brazil)
-Categorize each occupation-firm into a probationary period contract type
-Check for 1) evidence of advance notice; 2) rehiring of workers fired during probationary periods; and 3) consistency in probationary period contract type for other years

2) Causal Graph:
-Frame the causal graph for collective bargaining agreements as a selection model
-Frame the causal graph for the economic model of firm's firing decisions as the outcomes model

3) Estimation Strategy: 
-Explore the possibility of reduced form estimation through bunching
-Explain the pros and cons of using MLE vs. SMM
-Make sure Python code generates sensible simulations
-Start process of estimation
