Fourth Journal Entry: 03/04/2017

Here is my latest progress on the main tasks:

1) Collective Bragaining Agreements:
-No progress here

2) Causal Graph:
-Uploaded a new version of the CausalGraph (there were some mistakes in the previous version)
-Uploaded a new document called CausalEstimation to work on model
--> Provide a full economic model of my problem
--> Mapping this to causal graphs is harder than I expected

3) Estimation Strategy: 
-No progress here
-Need to finish the model first
