Fifth Journal Entry: 04/18/2017

Here is my latest progress on the main tasks:

1) Collective Bragaining Agreements:
-No progress here

2) Causal Graph:
-Drew a causal graph for the economic model of how probationary period length affects layoffs 
-Created Jupyter notebooks to explain the motivation behind this project and the intuition behind the causal graphs

3) Estimation Strategy: 
-Finished writing an economic model
-I am thinking about estimating it with simulated method of moments
-Wrote Python code to generate simulations... still needs some debugging
-Created Jupyter notebooks to show my progress in terms of the simulations
