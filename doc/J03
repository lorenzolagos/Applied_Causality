Third Journal Entry: 02/28/2017

Here is my latest progress on the main tasks:

1) Collective Bragaining Agreements:
-For current analysis I plan to back out the length of the probationary period from th edata
-In particular, I will look at a region-occupation-year triple and check the histogram of end of period contract terminations
-Based on the observed bunching, I will assign a probationary period length

2) Causal Graph:
-Uploaded a new version of the causal graph
-Identification is satisfied in this new causal graph
-Started work on model

3) Estimation Strategy: 
-No progress here
-Need to build a model first
