Fifth Journal Entry: 03/29/2017

Here is my latest progress on the main tasks:

1) Collective Bragaining Agreements:
-Written code in state to back out the length of the probationary periods
-Backing out is the best thing I can do because very few of the collective bargaining agreements specify the probationary period length
-Moreoever, when the probationary period length is mentioned, there is no variable that allows me to match the agreement to th eemployer-employee matched database
-I back out the probationary period length as follows:
  a) Take years 2003-2010 of spell-year observations, removing unidentifiable individuals and duplicates in terms of (worker, firm, year,      hire date)
  b) Remove observations in which a worker is rehired by the same firm (because probationary periods may not apply to these workers)
  c) Remove observations where the worker has worked in the same occupation for another firm in the past (because probationary periods may      not apply to these workers)
  d) Keep observations of urban workers with open ended contract that were hired under normal conditions with monthly wages
  e) Keep observations that were separated from their employer under "Layoff" within 4 months of tenure (since this is the only relevant        period)
  f) Keep observations that were separated from their employer under "End of Contract" within 3 months of tenure (since this is the only relevant period)
  g) For each (firm, occupation, year) triple calculate the following
    (i)   the maximum tenure for an End of Contract separation... and the number of observations used in the calculation
    (ii)  the mode tenure for an End of Contract separation (excluding the maximum)... and the number of observations used in the                   calculation
    (iii) the minimum tenure for a Layoff separation (may ignore this since it's not crucial)
  h) Keep the maximum for those where at leats 5 observations were used in the calculation, the mode for those where at least 3                  observations were used in the calculation, and the minimum
  i) The probationary period length for ecah (firm, occupation, year) triple is a contract at the mode (rounded to 1, 1.5, 2, and 3)          which can be renewed to the maximum (rounded to 1, 1.5, 2, and 3)

2) Causal Graph:
-No progress here
-I realized that causal model is a helpful guide, but my identification strategy relies on quasi-random variation indictated by the discontinuity in the firing cost schedule at the end of the probationary period
-Similar to what is done for regression discontinuity design or instrumental variables, I want to map this bunching approach to a causal graph

3) Estimation Strategy: 
-No progress here
-Need to finish the model first
